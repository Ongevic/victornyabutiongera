Hi! I'm Victor Nyabutiongera, a researcher focusing on the syntax and semantics of Bantu languages. My work combines theoretical linguistics, experimental fieldwork, and computational analysis to uncover patterns across languages. Currently pursuing a PhD at Aarhus University, I explore how generative syntax frameworks can model complex linguistic phenomena.

Welcome to my academic portfolio.
